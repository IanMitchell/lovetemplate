Just a little template/starter for [Löve2D](http://love2d.org) games. Comes by default with the `conf.lua` and `main.lua` files, directories for additional game and third party code, a directory for content, and a build system for packaging the game up for distribution<sup>1</sup>. Each directory contains a README you can see for further information.

The sublime-project included has a build system that can be used. It will appear in the menu as "Löve2D Game". It assumes an executable named 'love' is available. In OS X you achieve this by making a link to the application into /usr/bin using the Terminal:

    sudo ln -s /Applications/love.app/Contents/MacOS/love /usr/bin/love

<sup>1</sup> The build system is written in Ruby but currently leverages OS X shell commands. Work would need to be done to make the script work appropriately in Windows.
